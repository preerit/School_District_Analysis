# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
As a Data scientist for a city school district who is responsible for analyzing student information, we are preparing all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. We are analyzing data on student funding and studentsâ€™ standardized test scores. Our task is to aggregate data and showcase trends in school performance. This analysis will assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities. 
The school board has notified us that the one of the student files shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to us for help. We have been asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once we have replaced the math and reading scores, we have to write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
